# Spark & Marnee — SaaS Front‑End Project  
**Academic & Portfolio Version**

## Student

## Academic Context

This project was developed as part of my higher‑education curriculum oriented toward **SaaS applications, cloud‑ready architectures, and digital product development**.

The goal was to design a **front‑end SaaS application** that follows modern web standards while integrating key academic concerns such as:
- project structuring,
- cloud deployment readiness,
- scalability,
- and **GDPR (RGPD) compliance by design**.

---

## Project Overview

*Spark & Marnee* is a front‑end prototype of a SaaS platform offering online services (coaching, content, and community access).  
The application is designed as a **service‑oriented digital product**, not a static website.

It demonstrates how a SaaS interface can:
- guide user journeys,
- trigger interaction events,
- and serve as a foundation for future cloud services.

---

## Learning Objectives (Curriculum Alignment)

This project validates the following academic competencies:

- Design of a **SaaS‑oriented front‑end architecture**
- Use of **modern tooling compatible with cloud environments**
- Modular and maintainable styling using **SCSS**
- Separation of concerns between structure, style, and logic
- Awareness of **data protection and GDPR constraints**
- Ability to deliver a production‑ready project repository

---

## Technical Architecture

### Front‑End Stack
- HTML5
- SCSS (SASS) with modular architecture
- JavaScript / TypeScript
- Vite (modern bundler)

## Cloud‑Ready Design

The application is compatible with static or serverless cloud deployments:
- Vercel
- Netlify
- GitHub Pages

This separation between front‑end and backend services follows SaaS best practices and allows future scalability.

---

## GDPR & Privacy by Design

The project integrates GDPR awareness from the design stage:
- No personal data is collected without explicit consent
- UI structure allows future integration of:
  - cookie consent banners
  - compliant forms (opt‑in)
- Designed to support EU‑based hosting
- Privacy considered as a core functional requirement

---

## Academic Outcomes

This project demonstrates my ability to:
- build a SaaS‑ready front‑end,
- understand cloud deployment constraints,
- apply privacy and compliance principles,
- and deliver a clean, well‑documented academic repository.

---

## Future Improvements

- Backend API integration
- User authentication
- Secure data storage
- Full GDPR workflow implementation
- CI/CD cloud deployment pipeline

---

*This project is both an academic deliverable and a portfolio artifact demonstrating SaaS, cloud, and compliance awareness.*
